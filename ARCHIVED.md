# Repository Archived

This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained.

## New Locations

- **Portfolio Website**: My professional portfolio is now available at [shahmeetk.github.io](https://shahmeetk.github.io)
- **Blog Posts**: My technical blog posts are available at [github.com/shahmeetk/blogs](https://github.com/shahmeetk/blogs)

Please update your bookmarks and references to use the new URLs. This repository is kept for historical purposes only and will not receive any updates.

## Reason for Archiving

This repository was originally used for my professional portfolio and blog posts. I have since moved:

1. The portfolio to a dedicated repository at [github.com/shahmeetk/shahmeetk.github.io](https://github.com/shahmeetk/shahmeetk.github.io)
2. The blog posts to a dedicated repository at [github.com/shahmeetk/blogs](https://github.com/shahmeetk/blogs)

This reorganization provides a cleaner structure with separate repositories for different purposes.
