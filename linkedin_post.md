# How I Built My Professional Portfolio with GitHub Pages: A Step-by-Step Guide

I'm excited to share my newly redesigned professional portfolio showcasing my expertise in AI, Cloud Management, and DevSecOps! Check it out here: https://shahmeetk.github.io/Resume/

For those interested in creating your own professional portfolio using GitHub Pages, here's a detailed guide based on my experience:

## 1. Set Up Your GitHub Repository
- Create a new repository on GitHub (I named mine "Resume")
- Initialize it with a README.md file that will serve as your project documentation
- Add an MIT License to make your code shareable while protecting your rights
- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Resume.git`

## 2. Design Your Portfolio Structure
- Create an organized file structure for better maintainability:
  ```
  Resume/
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── css/styles.css       # All styling in one organized file
  │   ├── js/script.js         # Interactive elements and animations
  │   └── images/              # Profile photos and other images
  ├── index.html               # Main portfolio page
  ├── README.md                # Project documentation
  ├── .nojekyll                # Prevents GitHub from processing with Jekyll
  └── .github/workflows/deploy.yml  # Automatic deployment configuration
  ```
- In my portfolio, this structure keeps everything organized and makes updates simple

## 3. Create Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files
- Build a responsive index.html with semantic sections:
  - Header with your photo, name, and title (I used a circular profile image with a subtle hover effect)
  - Navigation menu with smooth scrolling to different sections
  - About section highlighting your expertise (I focused on AI, Cloud, and DevSecOps)
  - Experience timeline showing career progression
  - Skills section with visual indicators of proficiency
  - Education and certifications to establish credibility
  - Contact information for networking opportunities
- Style with CSS using:
  - CSS variables for consistent color scheme (I used blue tones that convey professionalism)
  - Responsive grid layouts that adapt to any screen size
  - Subtle animations and transitions for a polished feel
  - Media queries to ensure mobile compatibility
- Add JavaScript for interactivity:
  - Smooth scrolling navigation
  - Animated section reveals as you scroll
  - Active state highlighting in the navigation menu

## 4. Showcase Your Expertise with Compelling Content
- In my portfolio, I highlighted three core areas:
  - **AI & Machine Learning**: Implementing AIOps, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation
  - **Multi-Cloud Management**: Architecting environments across Azure, AWS, and GCP
  - **DevSecOps & Security**: Building secure CI/CD pipelines with automated security testing
- Include specific achievements from your experience:
  - Quantify results where possible ("Reduced deployment time by 70%")
  - Highlight technologies you've mastered
  - Show the business impact of your work
- Feature your education and certifications strategically:
  - I highlighted my Ph.D. research in AI-driven cloud infrastructure
  - Organized certifications by platform (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## 5. Set Up GitHub Pages Deployment
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
  permissions:
    contents: write
    pages: write
    id-token: write
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
          uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
          with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: .
            force_orphan: true
  ```
- This configuration automatically deploys your site whenever you push changes to the main branch
- Add a `.nojekyll` file to prevent GitHub from processing your site with Jekyll

## 6. Optimize for Recruiters and Search Engines
- Use industry-specific keywords throughout your content:
  - In my case: "AIOps," "Multi-Cloud Architecture," "DevSecOps"
  - Include specific technologies: "Kubernetes," "Terraform," "Azure ML"
- Structure your content for quick scanning:
  - Clear section headings
  - Bulleted lists for skills and achievements
  - Visual hierarchy with varying font weights and sizes
- Ensure fast loading times:
  - Optimize images (I compressed my profile photo)
  - Minimize CSS and JavaScript
  - Use modern image formats like WebP where supported

## 7. Test and Refine
- Test your portfolio on multiple devices and browsers
- Ask for feedback from colleagues in your industry
- Make iterative improvements based on feedback
- In my case, I adjusted the profile photo positioning to ensure my full face was visible
- I also enhanced the content to focus more specifically on AI, Cloud Management, and DevSecOps

## 8. Share Your Portfolio
- Update your LinkedIn profile with the portfolio link
- Share it in relevant professional communities
- Include it in your email signature
- Reference it in job applications

The best part? This entire setup is completely free and gives you full control over your professional brand. Plus, you're showcasing your technical skills just by having built it!
